AND you may think this is the end...but sadly it is not! 
Indeed we know that Java is the answer, but can you use prior knowledge to find the email in the gibberish of the file GIBBERISH.txt.

Once you found this email address (again using prior git command knowledge) checkout the branch of the statement before the @.
